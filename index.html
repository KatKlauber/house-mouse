    <h1>A SMALL KINDNESS</h1>
    <h2>Humane Mouse Removal</h2>
    <img src="images/mouse.jpeg" alt="House mouse">
    <p><span>Is there a</span>
      <br>MOUSE
      <br><span>in your</span>
      <br>HOUSE?</p>
    <p>Simply pick up some humane traps from the store (<a href="https://www.homedepot.com/p/Victor-Multi-Catch-Live-Mouse-Trap-M333/202668291" alt="" target="_blank">Home Depot</a> has some!), fill the bait corner with peanutbutter, set the traps where you saw the mouse/evidence of a mouse, and wait for sounds indicating it has entered the trap.</p>
    <p>Once the mouse is caught, put on some gloves, carry the trap to a safe, wooded location</p>
      <ol>
        <li>near water</li>
        <li>away from major urban developments</li>
        <li>and more than 2 miles away from your home</li>
      </ol>
    <p>Once you've found the perfect spot, slide open the top of the trap (with gloves still on), and let little Fievel go.</p>
    <h3>Too squeamish to pick up the trap and set it free? I'll <em>gladly</em> do it for you!</h3>
